ebola-visualisation
===================

For a school assignment we had to make a data-visualization of an actual subject. I chose to visualize the spread of Ebola over the world.
I used a data-set from http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html.

Further improvements following soon!
